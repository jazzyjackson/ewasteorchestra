<h3>Harddrive Guitar using Arduino, Firmata, and Pd-Extended</h3>

<img width="800px" src="./hdguitarperformance.jpg"/>

<p> Works with the latest Firmata as of 4/20/2016 as distributed with Arduino 1.6.8. Sound synthesis by <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended">pd-extended version 0.43.4</a>, which is apparently deprecated but I'll have to catch up another time.</p>
<p> The arduino object (a.k.a. <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads/pduino">pduino</a>) by <a href="http://www.at.or.at/hans/pd/objects.html">Hans-Christoph Steiner</a> is distributed in the same folder as harddrivepackage.pd for out of the box functionality. </p>
